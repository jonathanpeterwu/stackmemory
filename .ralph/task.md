COORDINATION GUIDELINES:

- Save progress to shared context regularly
- Check for updates from collaborators
- Request help if blocked for more than 2 iterations
- Report completion immediately

Remember:
- You are part of a swarm working on: Fix remaining swarm implementation issues: git commit integration, agent cleanup optimization, and resource management for larger swarms
- Other agents are working on related tasks
- Communicate findings through StackMemory shared context
- Focus on your specialization while being aware of the bigger picture
- Detect and avoid pathological behaviors (infinite loops, tunnel vision)
