description: StackMemory checkpoint - save current context
---

Perform a StackMemory checkpoint:

1. Use the `get_hot_stack` tool to review the current active context
2. Identify any important decisions, constraints, or learnings from this session
3. Use `add_anchor` to save any critical decisions with type DECISION, CONSTRAINT, or LEARNING
4. Summarize what context was captured

This ensures context persistence across sessions.
